## Design Approach

### UI/UX Design

The application features a dark-themed interface with blue accents for a modern, professional look. Key design decisions include:

- **Card-Based Layout**: Each skip option is displayed in its own card with clear information hierarchy
- **Visual Skip Illustrations**: Custom SVG illustrations for different skip sizes
- **Color-Coded Indicators**: Green for allowed features, red for restrictions
- **Responsive Hide/Show**: Detail sections that can be toggled on smaller screens

### Development Approach

The application was built with the following considerations:

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular components for maintainability and reusability
2. **Responsive First**: Building with mobile responsiveness as a core requirement
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works on all devices with enhanced experiences on larger screens
4. **API Fallbacks**: Graceful handling of API failures with informative error messages
5. **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and proper ARIA attributes for screen readers
